# hashblot

Expressive hash visualization - http://hashblot.com

## What it is

Hashblot, at its most general level, is an algorithm for visualizing hash functions, by interpreting a sequence of bytes as a series of curves.

This repository contains a JavaScript library for converting byte sequences to SVG path attributes, and an HTML file that takes that output for the SHA-1 hash of a string and displays the resulting image. See the "Methods" section for the exact functionality it provides.

## Installation

For Node.js/browserify:

    npm install --save hashblot

For Bower:

    bower install hashblot

hashblot.js will assign to `exports.module` if present, and `window.hashblot` if not, allowing it to be required as a Node/browserify module or included as a `<script>` source.

## Methods

### hashblot.qpd

Takes a hexadecimal string with a length divisible by 8 and converts it to an SVG Path Description string, like so:

1. Interpret every group of 8 characters as 4 bytes and convert them to four decimal numbers. (The SVG spec states they can be separated by spaces or commas: since the numbers stand for 2 coordinate pairs, this implementation uses commas inside the pairs and a space between them, eg "1,2 3,4").
2. Prefix each group of 4 characters with "Q" to denote an absolute-positioned quadratic BÃ©zier, with the first two numbers as the X and Y coordinates of the control point, and the second two numbers as the X and Y coordinates of the end point.
3. Prefix the entire string with 'M' + the last two numbers, denoting that the 'pen' should be moved to the last position in the shape before drawing the curves, so it will finish as a closed path where it started.

### hashblot.qpath2d

Takes a hexadecimal string with a length divisible by 8 and an optional object implementing the [CanvasPathMethods][] `moveTo` and `quadraticCurveTo`.

[CanvasPathMethods]: http://html5index.org/Canvas%20-%20CanvasPathMethods.html

This function applies `moveTo` and `quadraticCurveTo` operations for the given hash (as described in `hashblot.qpd`) to the given object. If no object is given, this function will create a `new Path2D()` and return that.

### hashblot.sha1qpd, hashblot.sha1qpath2d

These are versions of `hashblot.qpd` and `hashblot.qpath2d` (respectively) that take a string, which is then converted to its SHA-1 hash and used with the corresponding function.

See `hashblot.bindSha1` for how the SHA-1 hash is determined.

### hashblot.bindSha1

The SHA-1 function for `hashblot.sha1qpd` and `hashblot.sha1qpath2d` is bound when one of these functions is first called. It can be bound sooner by calling `hashblot.bindSha1`, with an optional argument containing the SHA-1 function to use.

When `module` is defined, this function will require and use the `crypto` module to produce the SHA-1 hash.

Otherwise, it will try to use SHA-1 functions from the following projects, in order:

- [Rusha](https://github.com/srijs/rusha)
- [Forge](https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge#sha1)
- [SJCL](https://github.com/bitwiseshiftleft/sjcl)
- [jsSHA](https://github.com/Caligatio/jsSHA)
- [Paul Johnston's hex_sha1 function](http://pajhome.org.uk/crypt/md5/)
- [CryptoJS](https://code.google.com/p/crypto-js/)
- [PolyCrypt](https://github.com/polycrypt/polycrypt)

(Pull requests to add more implementations are welcome.)

If none of these are present (and `hashblot.bindSha1` wasn't called with a function to use), it will use whatever the value of `window.sha1` is as a last resort.

For SHA-1 functions that don't handle strings with character codes outside the 0-255 range (pretty much all of them), the string will first be converted to UTF-8 via the [unescape-encodeURIComponent method][1].
