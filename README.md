# hashblot

Expressive hash visualization - http://hashblot.com

## What it is

Hashblot, at its most general level, is an algorithm for visualizing hash functions, by interpreting a sequence of bytes as a series of curves.

This repository contains a JavaScript library for converting byte sequences to SVG path attributes, and an HTML file that takes that output for the SHA-1 hash of a string and displays the resulting image. See the "Methods" section for the exact functionality it provides.

## Installation

For Node.js:

    npm install --save hashblot

For browsers / anything else:

    bower install hashblot

hashblot.js will assign to `exports.module` if present, and `window.hashblot` if not, allowing it to be required as a Node/browserify module or included as a `<script>` source.

## Methods

### hashblot.qp

Takes a hexadecimal string with a length divisible by 8 and converts it to a series of SVG path components, like so:

1. Interpret every group of 8 characters as 4 bytes and convert them to four decimal numbers. (The SVG spec states they can be separated by spaces or commas: since the numbers stand for 2 coordinate pairs, this implementation uses commas inside the pairs and a space between them, eg "1,2 3,4").
2. Prefix each group of 4 characters with "Q" to denote an absolute-positioned quadratic BÃ©zier, with the first two numbers as the X and Y coordinates of the control point, and the second two numbers as the X and Y coordinates of the end point.
3. Prefix the entire string with 'M' + the last two numbers, denoting that the 'pen' should be moved to the last position in the shape before drawing the curves, so it will finish as a closed path where it started.

### hashblot.sha1qp

Takes a string and returns the hashblot.qp output of that string's SHA-1 hash.

When `module` is defined, this function will require and use the `crypto` module to produce the SHA-1 hash; otherwise, it will try to use [jsSHA](https://github.com/Caligatio/jsSHA), which you'll need to include first. I'm open to pull requests that make this function more flexible.

## Usage

See index.html for an example of using hashblot.js to generate an image.
